Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey
 who resided on a berry tree which was on the banks of a river.
 In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
 One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
 The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
 The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
 As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became very good friends.

 One day the monkey sends some fruits for the crocodile's wife.
 She ate the fruits and liked them, but was jealous as she didn't like her husband
 spending time with the monkey.
 She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the
 monkey's heart will be. Get me the monkeys heart."
 Crocodile was not willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
